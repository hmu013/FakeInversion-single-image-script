# FakeInversion-single-image-script
This is a script to get a prediction for a single image using my implementaiton of the fakeinversion model.
The scrips loades an image as a base64 string because that is the inputt for a competition it might be uses in.

Result for the two models on SynRIS:

![Results w. Residuals](assets/results_residuals.png)
![Results w.o. Residuals](assets/results_no_residuals.png)
